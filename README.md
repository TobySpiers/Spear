# About
'Spear' is a C++ OpenGL retro game engine built from scratch using the SDL2.0 framework. Rendering is performed using an old-school raycasting method similar to the techniques used by Wolfenstein 3D (1992). Polygons do not exist. Developed for fun in my spare time. Very much a WIP.

# Current features:
•  **3D Raycaster** with expanded capabilities beyond those found in traditional raycasters\
•  **An explorable world** including multistory walls/floors/ceilings and cutout textures\
•  **Built-in level editor** with simple save/load support

# Setup
• Open solution using latest Visual Studio\
• Set solution platform to x64\
• Ensure SpearGame is set as the startup project\
• Run the program
