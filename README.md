# About
'Spear' is a C++ OpenGL game engine built from scratch using the SDL2.0 framework. Developed for fun in my spare time. Very much a WIP.

# Current features:
•  **3D Raycast Renderer** with XY mouselook support (dynamically adjust ray density/resolution using left-click/right-click)\
•  **An explorable world** including multistory walls/floors/ceilings/bridges\
•  Built-in **level editor** (WIP)

# Setup
todo
